Captain, why did you leave there? 
Well, we thought we could find another place like earth but with different beauties, jo-jo.
And we found this place.
We thought we could escape war.
We thought we could well, we thought that we could build an even better place.
And it took us that we'd left our home a billion miles away to be only visitors here, transients because you can't put down roots in this ground.
But it was too late.
So we spent 30 years watching a clock and a calendar.
And waiting.
But we're not going to wait any longer, jo-jo.
We can't wait another day not another hour.
We're going back to the earth right now.
Al baines? Al baines! Al! You hear that noise? All of you, do you hear that? That's not a meteor.
That's not wishful thinking.
That's not make-believe or a phantom.
Those are rockets.
That's the ship.
The ship is here.
Mr. Benteen? I'm benteen.
Colonel sloane, commanding the galaxy vi.
