Captain benteen, uh i brought nothing but a ship and a crew- uh, a means of escape.
You say you have no diseases, no viruses.
Well, has it ever occurred to you why? It's because you live in a test tube, captain.
Antiseptic and germ-free.
And also sterile.
Oh, sure, you're a group, sure, you're a cell, but that's all over with now, captain.
Now it's time to be what god meant you to be- individuals.
A man, a woman, a child, a being.
It's time to break that test tube.
It's time to rejoin the race of men.
I remember the race of men, colonel.
I remember the earth.
It's incredible.
Absolutely incredible.
For 30 years, i've been wrong.
to my people.
I've told them about an earth that doesn't exist.
I've told them about an imaginary garden.
I've told them about a planet a billion miles away that has no more substance than a wish.
We can't go back to earth, colonel.
It's too late for us.
