Hank, anything? Nothing yet, captain.
No sound at all.
Well, try it on.
402.
Probably coming from that direction.
I had it on that all morning, sir.
Oh.
Try it again.
Captain anything? No, nothing yet, joan, nothing yet.
They lost, you figure, captain? They're not lost, george, just takes time, that's all.
Takes time.
Julie, where's your husband? In our bunker, captain.
Something wrong? Go get him.
