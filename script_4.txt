That's all we got, captain.
None left? That's all of it right there.
Main switch? That's all gone, too.
We used it on the converter pumps.
Well, we've got to get current.
Temperature will go up without refrigeration.
We could stop the salt-water converter for a day or two.
Switch the parts.
That's what we'll have to do.
You tell the people to fill up all the jugs they've got.
We're going to turn off the water in six hours.
Yes, sir.
Oh, captain.
What about the ship? It's on the way, george.
We know it's on the way.
And when we get back, it's going to be different.
Things that are old and worn out, we're just going to throw them away.
Just throw them away.
Captain benteen.
Cut her down.
Oh, no prepare her for burial in an hour.
