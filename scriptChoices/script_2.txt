Yes, sir.
How's the water, george? Hot, flat and unforgettable.
But wet? Well, bear with it, folks, bear with it.
Six months' time, we'll all be drinking chocolate ice cream soda.
You want to see me, captain? Man on the radar tower like to see you, al- would've like to have seen you two hours ago when you were supposed to relieve him.
I overslept, captain.
You tell that to hank parker up there, will you? You tell him that you overslept.

That's not fair- it doesn't happen often.
Once is often.
More than once is intolerable.

I prefer it to a stupid game in the hot sun.
Game, al? What are we listening for up there? what have we ever heard? Wind noise.
What did we ever pick up on radar? Dust particles.
