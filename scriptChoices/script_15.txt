Colonel sloane? Yes.
Captain benteen is here.
Oh, yes.
Oh, come in, captain.
Come in.
Colonel.
Well, how are you today? Fine.
Thank you.
I have a list of your passengers, and their approximate weights.
Also, the weight of their belongings noted after each name.
We weighed on our scale, and i'm afraid it's an old-timer, underweighs about four or five pounds.
All i wanted was an approximation, captain.
Oh, this will do just fine.
We'll weigh them out on our own equipment before we blast off anyway.
Well, captain, today's wednesday.
