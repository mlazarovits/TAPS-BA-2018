Well, my friends any business to transact today? No business? Jo-jo.
Jo-jo nothing from you today? Don't you want me to tell you about the earth, jo-jo? Don't you want to hear about the rivers and the seas, the blue skies and night, the stars and moon? Don't you want to hear about all those things today? There's color on earth.
The change of the seasons, the wind.
The wind brings the smell of the ground- the plants, the seeds, the roots, the flower petals, the sap from the trees.
The wind brings with it the smell of the weather, the rain, the mist, the fog and the earth is green, jo-jo.
Green.
The color green.
The feeling green.
There's something so fresh about it.
So alive about it.
So living about it.
It's the earth.
The earth.
