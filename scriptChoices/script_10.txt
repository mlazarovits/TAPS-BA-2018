The earth! Colonel, has the earth changed? No, not too much.
Is it still green? It's still green.
And the cities? And the cities still stand.
And war? One pops up here, another dies out there, but through a miracle and the grace of god we never had the hydrogen war.
Captain benteen.
George, george.
Colonel sloane, this is george morris.
How do you do? I think you'll find it very much as you left it, mr. Benteen.
Captain benteen.
That's what people call me.
This place was my responsibility for 30 years.
You've done quite a job.
But you can rest easy.
We'll handle the responsibility.
I've become used to the functions.
Your quarters, they're underground.
As i was- cooler there, mr. Benteen? I where? I didn't hear what you said.
Your underground rooms, are they cooler? They're refrigerated.
But it's captain benteen.
Captain benteen's kept us alive here.
I believe it, captain benteen.
