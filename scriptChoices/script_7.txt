I think the worst is over.
I think the worst is over.
Quiet.
You're not scared, are you, jo-jo? Kind of, captain.
Well, we can't have you being scared.
Let's you and me talk a bit, huh? Pass the time.
Captain, tell us about the earth.
Do that, captain, would you? Tell us about the earth as you remember it? Again, jerry? All right, i'll talk about it.
Fran you and hank fill in any holes i leave.
If i'm wrong about any of my recollections, correct me, will you? Jo-jo, i was just a boy when we arrived here.
I was 15 years old, but i remember the earth.
I remember it as a place a place of color.
I remember, jo-jo, that in the autumn jo-jo? In the autumn the leaves changed turned different colors.
Red, orange, gold.
I remember streams of water that flowed down hillsides.
And the water was sparkling and clear.
And i remember clouds in the sky.
White billowy things floated like ships, like sails.
You see, in ancient times that's the way men moved their ships across the water.
They unfurled large sections of canvas against the wind and the wind moved them.
And i remember night skies.
Night skies like endless black velvet.
With stars sometimes a moon hung as if suspended by wires lit from inside.
What's night, captain? Night night was a quiet time, jo-jo, when the earth went to sleep.
Kind of like a cover that it pulled over itself.
Not like here where we have the two suns always shining, always burning.
It was darkness, jo-jo.
Darkness that felt like like a cool hand just brushed past tired eyes.
And there was snow on the winter nights- gossamer stuff- floated down and covered the earth, made it all white, cool.
And in the mornings, we could go out and build a snowman.
See our breath in the air.
And it was good then.
It was right.
