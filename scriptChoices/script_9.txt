Craggy mountains, salt flats, two suns, perpetually shining.
Yes, it all looks like this.
Yes, 30 years.
Some here have never seen earth, colonel.
Some older people don't remember what it looks like.
We are to get you on board as soon as possible.
We figured you should be ready to leave thursday.
That gives you three days to arrange things.
Unfortunately, your people can only take what they can carry.
There are over 150, right? But they'll travel standing on their heads.
That won't be necessary, mr. Benteen.
It'll be a little crowded, but we'll fit you all in.
I can see you're very used to a great deal of space, sir.
Space and heat! Yes, i can believe it.
