Tomorrow you think you'll be getting on a ship on its way to paradise.
Well, you'll be on your way to hell! What about you, captain? I'll stay here.
I'll stay here, this is my home.
This is where i belong.
This is where you all belong.
Captain, we leave at 0800 tomorrow morning.
Don't wait for a fetching committee.
not on board, you'll never be on board.
If you take off at 0800, you take off at 0800.
But as for the rest of you, you can go on this ship or you can remain here with me.
Captain? Benteen? We know you can hear us.
We know you're in here someplace.
Come out.
Please.
Let us talk to you.
We're leaving now, benteen.
We have to take off in five minutes or we'll lose our orbital position.
It'll be too late for us.
Benteen, it has to be now.
Captain, please.
Please come out.
If we leave without you, there'll be no ships returning here.
This is where you'll live from this moment on.
And this is where you'll die.
All right, benteen.
As you prefer.
Come on, let's go, baines.
Good-bye captain benteen.
