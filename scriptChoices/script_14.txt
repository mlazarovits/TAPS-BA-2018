Go to your homes.
I'll announce when the new day will begin.
Go to your homes.
Happy now, captain? I was never unhappy.
I just know what's right and what's wrong.
I see.
Colonel, i have to ask your men to stay on the ship.
I don't want the people distracted.
You do have a weighty fist, captain.
Well, had it been one ounce lighter, there'd be no one here to go back with you, colonel.
I've held these people together- by will.
They'd have died if they hadn't had someone to hang onto.
They'd have withered away.
Hmm.
Well, they're not going to wither away now, captain.
Why don't you just relax? That's a luxury i've never been able to afford.
I've never taken a wife.
I've never been able to think only of myself.
I've i've been confessor, governor, father figure, if you will.
And if i hadn't been, there'd be no life here today.
Those are my people, colonel.
Do you understand that? My people.
What's with him, colonel? What's his problem? Oh, suffer him a while longer.
He's really quite a guy, you know.
Quite a guy.
He just has one aberration: He thinks he's a god.
And we're booting him out of his heaven.
