Say your farewells now.
And ask god's forgiveness for what she has done.
Forgive her, lord.
Father, forgive her for what she's done.
She didn't know what she was doing, lord.
She knew what she was doing.
Better and clearer than any of the rest of us.
This is a funeral, al.
The ninth in the last six months, the ninth! This woman and the others took their lives because living became intolerable.
And i say that dying was their right.
That's a blasphemy! It's the truth.
Isn't living tough enough here we shouldn't have to go by the book? Isn't it hot and miserable enough there shouldn't be rules? We shouldn't have to suffer by the numbers? Will somebody please make the simple comment there's more happiness going into that grave, more peace of mind than all mourners put together? Nothing but anguish here.
Captain benteen, let us live with it in our own way.
Or let us die from it in our own way! Young mr. Baines would have us lie down in the sun.
Young mr. Baines would have us give in to death, while there is still life.
He'd end the rules.
Throw away the regulations.
No more standing in line for water.
We'll let the strong take away from the weak.
And no more food rationing.
Let the young steal from the old.
And when that ship does arrive it won't find a society.
Just a pack.
Not one human being left alive.
Only animals.
