This is william benteen who officiates on a disintegrating outpost in space.
The people are a remnant society who left the earth looking for a millennium, a place without war, without jeopardy, without fear.
And what they found was a lonely, barren place whose only industry was survival.
And this is what they've done for three decades- survive- until the memory of the earth they came from has become an indistinct, shadowed recollection of another time and another place.
One month ago, a signal from earth announced a ship would be coming to pick them up and take them home.
In just a moment, we'll hear more of that ship, more of that home and what it takes out of mind and body to reach it.
